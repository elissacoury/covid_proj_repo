# covid_proj_repo

This is a public repository version of the Covid-19 & Anti-Asian Hate group project done in COGS108 @ UCSD. Commit history was not able to be transferred over due to issues with not owning the original repository and only having collaborator status. All checkpoint files will be saved on this repo to present the work process through the project.
