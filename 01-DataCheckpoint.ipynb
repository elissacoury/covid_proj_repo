    "During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Anti-Asian American sentiments surged in the United States, leading to a sense of fear within Asian American communities. New, derogatory terminology also arose during this time as some referred to the virus as ‘Kung flu” or the “Chinese Virus” <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Specifically, a study from the University of Utah <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) shows that the distribution of hateful tweets against Asian Americans surged between January and March of 2020 where many began to use harmful language such as calling the virus the “Chinese Virus.”\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, survey data from the Pew Research Center illustrated the exact increase of anti-Asian discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this, they came to the conclusion that four out of 10 US-born Asian Americans personally know an Asian person who has been attacked or threatened ever since COVID-19 pandemic began <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). Additionally, although xenophobic sentiments have long existed through American history, the emergence of COVID-19 enabled the spread of racism and xenophobia, which may be associated with the increase in anti-Asian hate crime during the pandemic. During the pandemic, many tweets appeared where people stood against the hate crimes against Asian Americans that were recorded and posted. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). Another study conducted looked at hate crime information from police departments from New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington D.C. where they found that New York showed the greatest increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans with an increase of 3200% in 2020 compared to 2019. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). While hate crimes against Asian Americans increased, so did the use of racist terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the general impact the pandemic had on anti-Asian sentiments is widely recognized, the direct comparison and degree to which in person and online hate towards Asian Americans is not known precisely. Originally, our group had a bit of trouble deciding on what exactly to work with for our research question. We knew that we wanted to work with Social issues and possible something relating to COVID-19. In the end, we decided upon COVID and Anti-Asian American but were still unclear on how to make our research question more specific. Since our question was definitely not a novel idea, we decided in the end that we wanted to focus on the correlation between COVID-19 and any possible increase in Anti-Asian American by using data from in person hate crime statistics such as targeted robbers, assault, etc. as hateful speech and terminology made online through platforms such as Twitter (X), Instagram, and even news outlets well. Originally, we were considering searching for information in general, urban areas in the United States but ended up deciding to work with cases from major cities in the United States such as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, etc.\n",

    "As Asian-Americans have been surveyed to show that there has been an increase in racial discrimination against Asians since the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe there is a high positive correlation between COVID-19 rates and online anti-asian sentiment in the U.S.. Since COVID-19 caused Americans to move indoors and enforced social distancing, especially during the years 2020 and 2021, we predict that there would be more online hate rather than in person. We also believe that as online anti-asian hate increases, documented anti-asian hate crimes also increase."

    "Dataset #1\n",
    "- Dataset Name: Weekly United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by County\n",
    "- Link to the dataset: https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-/yviw-z6j5/data_preview\n",

    "- Number of variables: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Description of the variables most relevant to this project:\n",
    "- County: in what county were the COVID-19 case(s) recorded in\n",
    "- State: in what state were the COVID-19 case(s) recorded in\n",
    "- Date: when was the COVID-19 case(s) recorded\n",
    "- new_cases: how many new COVID-19 cases were recorded\n",
    "- One shortcoming is that this dataset does not have any race/ethnicity information which can be helpful in understanding the most frequent ethnicity that was victim to the most COVID cases. There also may be a lag between a surge COVID-19 case with hate incidents (may be before or even cause a surge in hate crimes after a case spike).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset #2 \n",
    "- Dataset Name: The Crime Data Explorer (CDE)\n",
    "- Link to the dataset: https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/downloads\n",
    "- Number of observations: 21025\n",
    "- Number of variables: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Description of variables most relevant to project:\n",
    "- data_year: year the crime was committed\n",
    "- state_abbr: abbreviation of state names, state that the incident occurred in\n",
    "- incident_date: yyyy-mm-dd of when the incident was reported\n",
    "- bias_desc: racial bias motivation \n",
    "- Some shortcomings of this dataset are that although there’s a lot of data on racial hate-crimes and hate crimes committed against Asian individuals, the dataset only provides information based on yearly reports. It will be difficult to get data that can give us information about whether these hate crimes spiked during certain months, or at times of the pandemic that we predict spikes will be based on COVID-19 spikes. There are no datasets that provide specific dates of when the hate crimes occurred or at what time they were reported. \n",
    "While this dataset contains information about documented hate crime incident reports, it overlooks any hate crimes that may have not been reported yet still experienced by Asian-Americans. This dataset could overlook other hate crime incidents that are not considered as serious legally, like microaggressions in a professional setting. Another shortcoming of the dataset is that it is possible that an agency has had a reporting error that could prevent some data from being reported. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset #3\n",
    "- Dataset Name: A Twitter Dataset of 40+ million tweets related to COVID-19\n",
    "- Link to the dataset: https://zenodo.org/records/3723940\n",
    "- Number of observations: 1000 for each n-gram dataset\n",
    "- Number of variables: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Description of variables most relevant to this project:\n",
    "- frequent_bigrams: frequent pairs of consecutive words used in tweets\n",
    "- frequent_terms: frequent terms used in tweets\n",
    "- frequent_trigrams: frequent group of three consecutive words used in tweets\n",
    "- counts: counts of the n-grams/terms frequently used in tweets\n",
    "- Since platforms such as Twitter often have bots as well, this may affect the most frequent terms/n-grams used and possibly overly inflate the true relevance of some. Additionally, the terms used may have been used in different contexts, an individual n-gram on its own may not completely reflect the context it was used in or the sentiment that it holds. There also may be differences in how words are spelled typing quirks, or typos in the tweets that affect the n-gram extraction. Other people may also use different terms than the ones accounted for in the dataset. While most data is in English, there is data that is in other languages, and the data is also collected from international tweets overall, so this can cause concern for applicability of the data, since we are only looking at U.S. and this dataset includes terms/n-grams that may not be used in the U.S.. Since the data is also purely from Twitter, it does not account for other social platforms that people may like using besides Twitter. All of these issues may raise an issue regarding bias in the data.\n",

    "### COVID-19 weekly cases and deaths by US county - CDC\n",
    "\n",
    "The Weekly United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by County dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is a comprehensive record of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths across the United States. The dataset is organized by week and U.S. jurisdiction. The data were compiled by the CDC and U.S. jurisdictions in a collaborative effort to ensure data accuracy. Throughout the data collection process, the CDC retrospectively updated totals to reflect correct data and address quality issues. \n",
    "Important metrics used in this dataset are “cumulative_cases” which provides the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in a county up to a specific date. “Cumulative_deaths” provides the total number of confirmed COVID-19 reported deaths in a county up to a specific date. “New_cases” refers to the amount of new COVID-19 cases reported in a county during that week. And “new_deaths” is the number of new COVID-19 related deaths that have been reported in a county during that week. Both case and death counts are represented as integer values. Cumulative cases and deaths reflect amounts that have been reported since the start of the pandemic, and new cases and deaths reflect weekly increments of the overall total. For example, within the dataset, Amador County in California was reported to have 1,679 cumulative cases, and 628 new cases on December 16th, 2020. This means that during that week, the total number of cases became 1,679, as 628 new reports were added to that total. These two variables showcase how “new” columns represent weekly change, and “cumulative” columns represent added totals. \n",
    "Within the dataset, other metrics include “fips_code” which represents the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code, providing a unique identifier for each jurisdiction. The “county” and “state” metrics are used to represent a county’s name along with a two letter abbreviation of the state where the county is located within. And “state_fips” refers to the FIPS code that is used to identify and differentiate states. County and state metrics are string/ text based, and use letters in order to be represented.  FIPS related metrics use integers of different lengths in order to differentiate counties and states. \n",
    "Some concerns and limitations of this dataset can be apparent through the different ways that counties and states may organize and report their data. As the data relies on indirect county-level counts through either an automated overnight web collection, or a direct submission, inaccuracies may be seen through reporting delays and inconsistency in how cases and deaths are classified across each state and county. Additionally, the CDC also claims that not all U.S. jurisdictions reported probable cases and deaths to the CDC, meaning that discrepancies may exist in the data due to differing COVID-19 surveillance and reconciliation efforts across the country.\n"

    "The Crime Data Explorer is a dataset provided by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that showcases incident-based data. It is organized by state and summary data estimates. This dataset also includes additional datasets, such as the Summary Reporting System, which contains the estimated data of the FBI’s crime totals at the state and national level, and Hate Crimes, which provides annual statistics of incidents, offenses, victims, and offenders in reported crimes that were motivated by victim ethnicity, race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability or sexual orientation. \n",
    "The metrics involved in this dataset are\n",
    "\n",
    "One concern/limitations for this dataset is that since the data is entered in yearly increments, the information on hate crimes is not as clear. For example, if we wanted to understand if there were certain periods of times (ex. specific months/weeks) where Asian American hate crimes were committed more frequently, we would not be able to correlate any spikes in COVID-19 and the corresponding rise/decrease in Asian American hate. Another limitation of the data is that it only captures officially documented hate crime incidents. Many hate crimes, in reality, may go unreported because of fear of retaliation or the victim just feeling uncomfortable reporting the issues. Additionally, this dataset also only focuses on legally recognized hate crimes and may not include any other incidents such as microaggressions, discrimination, or verbal harassment experience in person. Lastly, there could also be an issue in reporting the hate crime. The hate crime reports could be lacking in confidence or information which could create bias/errors in the results."

    "###  Twitter Dataset of frequency terms related to COVID-19\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains 40+ million tweets that relate to COVID-19 and was taken from the platform near the earlier stages of the pandemic. The data was taken from the date January 1, 2020 through March 11, 2020. Phrases and terms relating to COVID-19 are said to be taken from all languages but the most prevalent languages that appeared were English, Spanish, and French.\n",
    "Some important metrics in this dataset are “counts”, “gram”, and “term”. “Counts” refers to how many times the word(s) appeared in the data, “gram” is just a short hand for either bigram or trigram and it refers to the occurrence of two/three consecutive words. The units these metrics are measured in are in occurrences. For example, gram could refer to bigram count. In the dataset it could show up as a pair of consecutive words like “China virus” and is counted once in the dataset every time it appears. This term could have 2000+ counts over the time period recorded in the dataset which means that there was widespread online discourse regarding racial stigmas and the disease. \n",
    "The main concern/limitation of this dataset is the presence of bots or troll accounts on Twitter. Bots may have been used to spam certain terms or phrases, making the figures for a certain term/phrase skew dramatically. Troll accounts also often amplify certain messages or even repost identical content, distorting the actual frequency a term/phrase appears giving the impression that certain sentiments were more prevalent than in reality. Another concern is the contextual situations the terms/phrases were used in. For example, some tweets may have been tweeted in efforts to reprimand using such terms rather than in a harmful manner. Similarly, some people also purposely evade moderation by censoring the term/phrase by using other characters to replace the letters (ex: “ch*nese”/ch1nese”). Additionally, they could have used different keywords instead of censoring the words or outright typing them out. These issues could possibly underestimate the amount of times these terms/phrases appeared. Lastly, since the dataset only includes data from Twitter, it only reflects one social media platform. Different platforms serve different demographics and all use different means of communication. By using only this dataset to represent online hate, it could generalize all online spaces. \n"

    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data is collected on humans through social media posts, health information, and crime information. As we aren’t the ones collecting the data, it is assumed they have opted-in for this information as majority of it would be considered public data, and identities and not usually attached (possibly to tweets, but this can be anonymized).\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> For information that can be tied to an identity (like tweets), we can consider making sure tweets are kept anonymous and user IDs are not tracked and kept if they are in the datasets we use.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our team is recognizing and acknowledging intersectional identities when gathering our data. More specifically, we are ensuring that as we gather our data and analyze our sources, each racial group within the Asian community is respectfully accounted for.\n",
    "Additionally, we intend to filter and flag as much suspicious digital content from our datasets as possible. We are looking at serious offenses and anti-Asian sentiment from other humans in America. This means we are excluding spam, social media trends, personal jokes, etc. There is a likelihood that we may missclassify or overlook content that is not meant to be a harmful intent of anti-Asian sentiment, we acknowledge that this serves as a limitation of authenticity and reliability for our project findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have decided to focus on broadly looking at popular keywords and statements being posted on social media. All of our datasets are publicly available, so breach of privacy is not a concern. Additionally, within our project we will be focusing on keywords and common statements and avoiding the act of showcasing any display of personal account info. (ex: usernames)\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Some assumptions we should acknowledge are the definitions of key terms we are using such as Anti-Asian and Asian-American. When we say this, we refer to East, SouthEast, Central, and South Asian, as typically considered in this category by the US census. We should acknowledge however that Asian can also encompass other areas like West/Southwest/Northeast Asia which are not typically included and will usually be included in other racial or ethnic categories than “Asian”. Within “Asian” as we have it defined for this project, not every group may experience the anti-Asian sentiment that may be a result of COVID-19, which should also be acknowledged, as it could have influences on the analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We are closely examining datasets that directly label the in person hate crime as anti-asian hate crime. This limitation will reduce our findings and research pool. This limitation was set as to avoid any misanalysis and incorrectly label a crime that may or may not potentially be driven by bigotry. \n",
    "Additionally, since we are only investigating a specific demographic in regards to the rise of COVID 19 and online vs in person hate sentiment, this is essentially a bias and overlooking other ethnicity groups that may have experienced similar discriminatory behavior during this time period.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A majority of our correlation-findings will be presented through graphs, we intend to use these visualizations to better display any discoveries. Additionally, we aim to gather most physical “crime” dataset through official authority agencies (such as FBI, local police reports, etc) to ensure authenticity.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> As we intend to work with sentiment analysis and datasets centered around online hate, we should acknowledge how this is something that changes frequently, and while the data we use might not be collected in real time, there may be certain changes in terms that can have effects on the analyses (like concept drift), so we will make sure to continuously do human reviews with our analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
