    "During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, Anti-Asian American sentiments surged in the United States, leading to a sense of fear within Asian American communities. New, derogatory terminology also arose during this time as some referred to the virus as ‘Kung flu” or the “Chinese Virus” <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Specifically, a study from the University of Utah <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) shows that the distribution of hateful tweets against Asian Americans surged between January and March of 2020 where many began to use harmful language such as calling the virus the “Chinese Virus.”\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, survey data from the Pew Research Center illustrated the exact increase of anti-Asian discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through this, they came to the conclusion that four out of 10 US-born Asian Americans personally know an Asian person who has been attacked or threatened ever since COVID-19 pandemic began <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). Additionally, although xenophobic sentiments have long existed through American history, the emergence of COVID-19 enabled the spread of racism and xenophobia, which may be associated with the increase in anti-Asian hate crime during the pandemic. During the pandemic, many tweets appeared where people stood against the hate crimes against Asian Americans that were recorded and posted. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). Another study conducted looked at hate crime information from police departments from New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington D.C. where they found that New York showed the greatest increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans with an increase of 3200% in 2020 compared to 2019. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). While hate crimes against Asian Americans increased, so did the use of racist terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the general impact the pandemic had on anti-Asian sentiments is widely recognized, the direct comparison and degree to which in person and online hate towards Asian Americans is not known precisely. Originally, our group had a bit of trouble deciding on what exactly to work with for our research question. We knew that we wanted to work with Social issues and possible something relating to COVID-19. In the end, we decided upon COVID and Anti-Asian American but were still unclear on how to make our research question more specific. Since our question was definitely not a novel idea, we decided in the end that we wanted to focus on the correlation between COVID-19 and any possible increase in Anti-Asian American by using data from in person hate crime statistics such as targeted robbers, assault, etc. as hateful speech and terminology made online through platforms such as Twitter (X), Instagram, and even news outlets well. Originally, we were considering searching for information in general, urban areas in the United States but ended up deciding to work with cases from major cities in the United States such as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, etc.\n",

    "1. Explain what the **ideal** dataset you would want to answer this question. (This should include: \n",
    "   1. **What variables?** We are looking for datasets that include social media posts or other forms of online data (e.g. news headlines possibly) that could help us with analyzing anti-asian sentiment online. These datasets would ideally have variables like post dates and text data (strings). We could try to do sentiment analysis based on this, or finding a dataset that already has done this would also be great. Finding datasets that have already summarized words about COVID on social media platforms could also be helpful. We are also looking for datasets that include information about reported hate crimes in the U.S., specifically major cities. Within these datasets, we would ideally have variables about date reported, race/ethnicity of the victim, location, and crime reported, as these seem the most important for our intended analyses as of now, although other information may prove to be important as well. We would want all collected data to be from 2020 (beginning covid to compare to  covid increase period) to present day. Datasets of surveys of Asian-Americans may also be useful. We would also need data on COVID-19 rates throughout 2020-present day to be able to track the timeline of anti-asian sentiment online, through documented hate crimes, and of COVID rates at the same time. This data would ideally include dates and infection rates/counts of COVID-19 as well as location, either daily, weekly, or monthly to keep the most accurate tracking.\n",
    "   2. **How many observations are needed?** When considering datasets that may have a row for every online post, thousands of observations would be ideal. If the data concerning online sentiment is in a different format such as bigrams and counts, this may be much less. For datasets concerning reported hate crimes, we would also want and expect thousands of reports as we are looking over multiple years. High numbers of observations are ideal to make any conclusions we get more reliable and not due to any bias that may be present in small amounts of observations. For the COVID-19 tracking data we would also need many observations, which would be in the thousands if daily, or hundreds if data is recorded in more spaced out increments. The most important part is that the data can be linked by time across many datasets.\n",
    "   3. **Who/what/how would these data be collected?** Datasets may be collected through surveys, possibly web-scraping (self-done) for social media posts, other people who have already collected social media posts about COVID and the issue we are looking into (likely through web-scraping), official organizations/bureaus (like FBI for hate crime reports).\n",
    "   4. **How would these data be stored/organized?** In python notebooks, we will likely store and organize most data in pandas DataFrames. Outside of python notebooks, data may be stored in text, csv, tsv, or other types of files. We would convert these to DataFrames when we read them into our project python notebooks.\n",

While some of the datasets come as txt files and would need to be parsed for usability (like the master files), they include important variables such as offense, date, county, and kind of hate crime (of which anti-asian is a category). Hate_Crime.csv is very large with over 1 million rows for all hate crime incident reports 1991-2024. The statistics downloads may be useful for aggregates if we want to use those.\n",

These csv files include the top 1000 terms/grams, and can be useful for our online data sentiment analysis. full_dataset_clean.tsv is a tab-separated-values file with only twwets (no retweets) and includes over 7 million unique tweets."

    "\n",
    "> Data is collected on humans through social media posts, health information, and crime information. As we aren’t the ones collecting the data, it is assumed they have opted-in for this information as majority of it would be considered public data, and identities and not usually attached (possibly to tweets, but this can be anonymized).\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> For information that can be tied to an identity (like tweets), we can consider making sure tweets are kept anonymous and user IDs are not tracked and kept if they are in the datasets we use.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our team is recognizing and acknowledging intersectional identities when gathering our data. More specifically, we are ensuring that as we gather our data and analyze our sources, each racial group within the Asian community is respectfully accounted for.\n",
    "Additionally, we intend to filter and flag as much suspicious digital content from our datasets as possible. We are looking at serious offenses and anti-Asian sentiment from other humans in America. This means we are excluding spam, social media trends, personal jokes, etc. There is a likelihood that we may missclassify or overlook content that is not meant to be a harmful intent of anti-Asian sentiment, we acknowledge that this serves as a limitation of authenticity and reliability for our project findings.\n",

    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We have decided to focus on broadly looking at popular keywords and statements being posted on social media. All of our datasets are publicly available, so breach of privacy is not a concern. Additionally, within our project we will be focusing on keywords and common statements and avoiding the act of showcasing any display of personal account info. (ex: usernames)\n",

    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Some assumptions we should acknowledge are the definitions of key terms we are using such as Anti-Asian and Asian-American. When we say this, we refer to East, SouthEast, Central, and South Asian, as typically considered in this category by the US census. We should acknowledge however that Asian can also encompass other areas like West/Southwest/Northeast Asia which are not typically included and will usually be included in other racial or ethnic categories than “Asian”. Within “Asian” as we have it defined for this project, not every group may experience the anti-Asian sentiment that may be a result of COVID-19, which should also be acknowledged, as it could have influences on the analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We are closely examining datasets that directly label the in person hate crime as anti-asian hate crime. This limitation will reduce our findings and research pool. This limitation was set as to avoid any misanalysis and incorrectly label a crime that may or may not potentially be driven by bigotry. \n",
    "Additionally, since we are only investigating a specific demographic in regards to the rise of COVID 19 and online vs in person hate sentiment, this is essentially a bias and overlooking other ethnicity groups that may have experienced similar discriminatory behavior during this time period.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A majority of our correlation-findings will be presented through graphs, we intend to use these visualizations to better display any discoveries. Additionally, we aim to gather most physical “crime” dataset through official authority agencies (such as FBI, local police reports, etc) to ensure authenticity.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",

    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> As we intend to work with sentiment analysis and datasets centered around online hate, we should acknowledge how this is something that changes frequently, and while the data we use might not be collected in real time, there may be certain changes in terms that can have effects on the analyses (like concept drift), so we will make sure to continuously do human reviews with our analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
